## Description
Try your best against this AI in an intense game of Tic-Tac-Toe, but quickly realize the only way to win, is to tie. This AI utilized the Minimax algorithm commonly used in game theory in order to always make the best possible move against the player, making it undefeated.

## Tasks 
- Construct a working game of Tic-Tac-Toe implementing turn-based 1v1 gameplay against an AI
- Develop an artifical intelligence to play against the user
- Utilize the Minimax Algorithm used in game theory to allow the AI to always make the most optimal move, making it virutally unbeatable

## What is MiniMax Algorithim
The Minimax algorithim is a backtracking algorithm primarily used in decision making and game theory in order to find the most optimal move for a player. However, this assumes that the opponent is also playing optimally, if not, the game will be over quickly. 

In the algorthin the moves of 2 players are constantly being taken into account, the **maximizer** and the **minimizer**. 
The maximizer is always trying to ge the highest score, while the minimizer is trying to get the lowest score possible.

While the AI is always calculating the best possible move it is also trying to find the fastest way to win as well constantly choosing between being the maximizer or minimizer after a player move.

This algorithim is mostly used in turn based 1v1 games such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, etc. 

## How to Run
This program runs in console. To run it and play against the AI, download the code and run using terminal.
